## Setup

Don't let the close-up photos fool you; this really is a tiny device. It's 3.5 cm x 2.7 cm x 1 mm and weighs 13 grams.

I must say that I'm a big fan of the straight punch tool included in this kit - it's by far the most comfortable I've used. It's also impressive how compact the device is, making it even more robust against deformation. And despite the small size, I didn't have any issues punching divots into it. This is a meticulously designed product, all the way down to the micro guide holes in each cell to help ensure that you have the straight punch centered. Switching to a binary encoding of the BIP39 line number further improves the compactness.

My biggest pain with this device was getting the camera to focus on it for detailed photos.

## Heat Stress Test

Barely even any discoloration.

## Corrosion Stress Test

Similar surface pitting as other titanium devices, but the template and data are fully legible.

## Crush Stress Test

This device is so small it was tricky to figure out how to attempt to deform it. Eventually I settled on putting all 20 tons of pressure onto its side.

Tinyseed withstood over 15 tons of force without deforming, and it wasn't until nearly 20 tons of force were applied that it finally gave in. However, the data is still legible. Obviously, if the force is applied directly onto the face of the device then it won't deform.
