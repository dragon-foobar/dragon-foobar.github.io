Copper Seed Safe can be purchased at <a href="https://copperseedsafe.com/">copperseedsafe.com</a>. This is essentially a paper thin sheet of copper. It claims to be:
<ul>
	<li>Fireproof</li>
	<li>Waterproof</li>
	<li>Easy to use</li>
	<li>Requires no special tools â€” write with a pencil or pen</li>
</ul>

## Setup

This was easy but slightly annoying because I wasn't sure how hard I needed to press down while writing on the copper sheet. My first few words were done at a fairly normal writing pressure while the rest were at high pressure to make the maximum indentation.

## Heat Stress Test

What's concerning here is you can see the top left edge appears to have melted a bit. The lightly imprinted words in the top left are nearly illegible with some slight data loss. The discoloration does not make it easier to read. Though I will note that reading the back side of the sheet of copper was a bit easier for some of the words.

## Corrosion Stress Test

Not great. We can see more of the copper sheet is disintegrating while the legibility of the remaining words is getting worse. Partial data loss.

## Crush Stress Test

No hydraulic press required.

Catastrophic failure.
