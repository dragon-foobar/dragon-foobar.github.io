## Setup

Personally I'm not a fan of it being two separate plates with no fastener. This is touted as a security feature because you can split the seed and hide it in 2 places, but of course that makes your backup more brittle and susceptible to loss. Also, the seed words are stored as hex which supposedly makes it less appealing for thieves, but I'd argue that is less appealing for anyone to use.

I'm not a fan of the hex encoding, but the straight punching of data is easy enough.
