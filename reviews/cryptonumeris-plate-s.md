## Setup

My biggest problem when stamping this plate is due to the small size. It was hard to get a good position on the plate without the plate itself bouncing around as I hammered it.

## Heat Stress Test

While the divots themselves are plainly visible, the concerning issue here is that the template is not nearly as robust as the data itself. If you completely lose the template and can't find another copy in the far future, this could be problematic. This is why I recommend templates be deeply etched into a device rather than printed / lightly engraved. However, it's far less of a concern with this device because the data is the fully stamped words rather than a dot-based encoding.

## Corrosion Stress Test

The template is completely gone but that's of little concern because we don't need it in order to decode the data on the device.

## Crush Stress Test

No data loss.
