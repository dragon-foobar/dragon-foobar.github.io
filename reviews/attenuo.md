## Setup

As usual, the straight punch method is one I find to be fastest and most user friendly.

## Heat Stress Test

Some discoloration and negligible amount of warping. No data loss.

## Corrosion Stress Test

In this case the Attenuo was too wide to fit flat in the bucket and thus was only partially submerged. A nice acid bath (left side) actually makes the Attenuo more legible. Although the dark lines of the template get erased, it's etched deep enough that the template itself remains legible.

## Crush Stress Test

No data loss.
