Codl Punchplate can be purchased at <a href="https://codl.co/">codl.co</a>. Made from .071" thick, 304 Stainless Steel, the Codl Punchplate claims to withstand:
<ul>
	<li>fire</li>
	<li>water</li>
	<li>corrosion</li>
	<li>crushing</li>
</ul>

## Setup

The first 4 letters of each word are encoded in a clockwise pattern starting from the top triangle, one word per column. This is highly compact but I would not recommend it for older folks. It requires precision to punch and pretty good eyesight to read.

I will note that the latest generation of this device has tiny "guide" divots where you see each dot in order to help you correctly align your straight punch.

## Heat Stress Test

No issues reading the data despite some expected discoloration.

## Corrosion Stress Test

While the plate survived quite well, it's exhibiting a unique phenomenon I haven't seen before. The acid is clearly enlarging the divots a bit, and due to how compactly designed the device template is, the enlarged divots are covering multiple spaces in some cases. As such, the decoding of the data is now at risk due to the ambiguity.

## Crush Stress Test

No data loss or remarkable changes compared to prior tests.
