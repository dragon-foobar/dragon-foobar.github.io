Coinplate Grid can be purchased at <a href="https://getcoinplate.com/">getcoinplate.com</a>. All Coinplates are 100% made of superior grade German Stainless Steel (AISI 304 / DIN1.4301) and use ultra thick (5mm) stainless steel plates joined with stainless bolts.

Coinplate claims to be:

<ul>
	<li>Fireproof up to 1,400°C / 2,500°F</li>
	<li>Waterproof</li>
	<li>EMP & X-ray proof</li>
	<li>Corrosion & rust resistant</li>
	<li>Pressure & impact resistant</li>
</ul>

One thing I'll note about the Coinplate devices - they are <strong>hefty</strong>. Each plate weighs over a pound; the joined plates weigh nearly 3 pounds.

## Setup

Punching divots in the Grid is easy, though it's more legible than the Coinplate Alpha because you aren't punching on top of printed letters.

## Heat Stress Test

Unfortunately a usability issue has arisen. I was unable to unscrew the fasteners holding the plates together using the provided star wrench; it was seized up pretty well, likely due to a small amount of deformation caused by expansion and contraction of the plates.

## Corrosion Stress Test

I was still unable to open this device but I'm confident the data is intact, as other Coinplate devices performed admirably through this tests.

## Crush Stress Test

I was finally able to get the device reopened after flattening it back out with the hydraulic press. We can see that while there has been some fading of the template, both it and the data are still fully intact and legible.
