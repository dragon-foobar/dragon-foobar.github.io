Willi's Recovery Seed Plate can be purchased via <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5323755.0">bitcointalk.org</a>. This is a very straightforward stainless steel plate measuring 100 x 100 x 4 millimeters. It's quite hefty.

Willi claims the plate will protect your seed phrase from:
<ul>
	<li>water</li>
	<li>fire</li>
	<li>corrosion</li>
	<li>mechanical damage</li>
	<li>other hazards</li>
</ul>
