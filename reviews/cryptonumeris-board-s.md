## Heat Stress Test

While the divots themselves are plainly visible, the concerning issue here is that the template is not nearly as robust as the data itself. If you completely lose the template and can't find another copy in the far future, this could be problematic. This is why I recommend templates be deeply etched into a device rather than printed / lightly engraved.

## Corrosion Stress Test

The data divots are doing well but the data template is even harder to make out than after the heat test. I'd say that this data is still recoverable with a bit of extrapolation from the legible parts of the template, but the trend is concerning.

## Crush Stress Test

No appreciable changes compared to previous tests.
