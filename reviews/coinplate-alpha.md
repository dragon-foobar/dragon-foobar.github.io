Coinplate Alpha can be purchased at <a href="https://getcoinplate.com/">getcoinplate.com</a>. All Coinplates are 100% made of superior grade German Stainless Steel (AISI 304 / DIN1.4301) and use ultra thick (5mm) stainless steel plates joined with stainless bolts.

Coinplate claims to be:

<ul>
	<li>Fireproof up to 1,400°C / 2,500°F</li>
	<li>Waterproof</li>
	<li>EMP & X-ray proof</li>
	<li>Corrosion & rust resistant</li>
	<li>Pressure & impact resistant</li>
</ul>

One thing I'll note about the Coinplate devices - they are <strong>hefty</strong>. Each plate weighs over a pound; the joined plates weigh nearly 3 pounds.

## Setup

The device is large and hefty, there are no problems punching the divots into it. Though trying to see the markings in a photo is pretty tough.

## Heat Stress Test

Unfortunately a usability issue has arisen. I was unable to unscrew the fasteners holding the plates together using the provided star wrench; it was seized up pretty well, likely due to a small amount of deformation caused by expansion and contraction of the plates.

## Corrosion Stress Test

Thankfully I was able to get the device opened again. We can see that although some of the parts of the template had their dark lines erased, both the template and data remain deeply etched and intact.

## Crush Stress Test

No data loss.
