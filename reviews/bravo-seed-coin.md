## Setup

Simple, straightforward setup.

One unique feature of the Bravo Seed products is that they come with perfectly sized stickers that you can use to cover the data. The idea being that you could glue a magnet on the other side and the casual observer would just assume that they are a fridge magnet. I put the stickers on for posterity, but clearly they will be destroyed by the fire test.

## Heat Stress Test

Obviously the sticker facade on the devices didn't last long, but that was just for fun.

This device had discoloration but no data loss. In this scenario the guide divots may actually be working against it, making it harder to differentiate the data from the blank template cells.

## Corrosion Stress Test

While there's no data loss we can see pitting all across the surface of the plate. Unlike the Bravo Seed Card, the divots do not appear to be enlarged by the acid. No data loss.

## Crush Stress Test

No data loss.
