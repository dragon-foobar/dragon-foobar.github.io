Coinplate Punch can be purchased at <a href="https://getcoinplate.com/">getcoinplate.com</a>. All Coinplates are 100% made of superior grade German Stainless Steel (AISI 304 / DIN1.4301) and use ultra thick (5mm) stainless steel plates joined with stainless bolts.

Coinplate claims to be:

<ul>
	<li>Fireproof up to 1,400°C / 2,500°F</li>
	<li>Waterproof</li>
	<li>EMP & X-ray proof</li>
	<li>Corrosion & rust resistant</li>
	<li>Pressure & impact resistant</li>
</ul>

One thing I'll note about the Coinplate devices - they are <strong>hefty</strong>. Each plate weighs over a pound; the joined plates weigh nearly 3 pounds.

## Setup

Stamping was a pain as usual, even when using a jig provided by ImpressSeed.

You'll notice I had a few light strikes at the beginning as I was trying to find a good surface for hammering and by the end some of my letters were rotated incorrectly because I didn't notice that the stamp had changed position after being struck.
