DIYSeed can be purchased at <a href="https://diyseed.net/">diyseed.net</a>. DIYSeed is meant to be a cheap and private way to create your own backup from commonly available items. It claims to be indestructible and not easy to read without the associated templates.

## Setup

Hard to screw this up!

## Heat Stress Test

The paper template guide burned off immediately as expected.

The underlying data remained intact. And you could use a new template (pictured on right) to decode the data.

## Corrosion Stress Test

The divots are quite clear and can be decoded with a (separate) transparent template placed on top of them.

## Crush Stress Test

No data loss, though as the device becomes more deformed it becomes harder to put a template on top of it to read the data. In extreme cases you'd likely need to flatten out the device again to achieve legibility.
