Cryo can be purchased at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0945YYMP6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00">amazon.com</a>. Claims to be:
<ul>
	<li>stainless steel</li>
	<li>durable</li>
	<li>each plate is 2mm thick for max durability</li>
	<li>rust-proof</li>
	<li>water-proof</li>
	<li>fireproof up to 2500Â°F</li>
</ul>

The outer CRYO plates protect the inner seed word plates from physical damage. The cover plate with the logo can also be flipped over to make the cold storage backup discreet and unremarkable.

## Setup

Straightforward straight punching on these plates; I had no issues.

## Heat Stress Test

This device absorbs and dissipates heat like a champ; you can compare it to the qreg on the left that does not appear to react nearly as much.

Upon inspection of the cooled device we see it has no data loss.

## Corrosion Stress Test

Holding up quite well; no data loss.

## Crush Stress Test

I hit a usability issue that I unfortunately saw coming. After deforming the stack of plates, I could no longer unscrew the fasteners - they were seized up.

I tried flattening out the device again in the hopes that I'd be able to unscrew the fasteners, but I had no luck. However, despite not being able to view the data I'm quite confident that it's still intact and could be accessed with more powerful tools.
