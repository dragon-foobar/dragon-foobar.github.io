ImpressSeed can be purchased at <a href="https://impressseed.com/">impressseed.com</a>. Claims to be:
<ul>
	<li>Fire Resistant up to 3000Â°F</li>
	<li>Corrosion resistant to acid, rusting, saltwater</li>
	<li>Crush proof: solid plate, deeply stamped</li>
</ul>

## Setup

It was really annoying to stamp the letters into this plate due to its small size. And due to the thinness, the plate itself warped and curved inward with additional stamping along the sides. One nice aspect was that ImpressSeed includes their own jig which makes it far more manageable. However, I noted that after several hundred strikes the jig started to fail, similar to how I've seen other plastic jigs give in to fatigue.

## Heat Stress Test

Slight discoloration around the edges but no data loss.

## Corrosion Stress Test

Like some of the other titanium devices we can observe substantial pitting of the service. A tiny amount of data loss with regard to the more lightly stamped letters. This seed phrase is certainly still recoverable.

## Crush Stress Test

No additional data loss.
