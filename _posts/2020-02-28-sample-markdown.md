>
> I first encountered bitcoin approximately two years ago. Prior to
> that, my understanding of economics was limited to introductory
> courses I had taken at university. Much like my fellow peers, I found
> myself lost in the complexity of the mathematical models, leading me
> to accept the notion that if the math added up, the logic must
> naturally follow. However, my perspective underwent a significant
> shift towards the end of 2020 when a friend introduced me to bitcoin
> by recommending Lex Friedman\'s podcast with Safedean Amous and, like
> so many others before me, I fell deep down the rabbit hole.
>
> Since that moment, I have immersed myself in countless hours of
> content, including news articles, books, and podcasts, delving into
> every facet of bitcoin, from its digital security and mining to wealth
> management tools and Austrian monetary theory. The challenge, however,
> lies in distilling this wealth of information into a format that
> resonates with individuals who, much like myself in 2020, are not yet
> deeply engrossed in the subject matter. If you\'ve ever encountered a
> similar struggle of summarizing and organizing complex thoughts, then
> this is for you.
>
> This paper presents a clear and strategic approach to reaching
> individuals who are less informed about bitcoin, often referred to as
> \"Normies.\" This approach is encapsulated in what we call the
> \"Orange Pill\" methodology.
>
> For the purposes of this paper, a \"Normie\" is defined as someone who
> exhibits the following characteristics:
>
> ● They are unfamiliar with the concept of \'fiat money\' and lack an
> understanding of how government-issued currency is created, beyond the
> term \'money printing.\'

> **Link these Properties to bitcoin**:\
> ● Form a strong connection between the identified properties and how

> In my perspective, initiating an \"orange pill\" moment hinges on
> people developing a profound aversion to inflation. They should gain
> an understanding of its origins, who it favours, who it hinders, and
> who it empowers. If ordinary individuals took the time to contemplate
> the implications of inflation, it might well lead to widespread
> unrest. Are we to believe that the money we\'ve earned through our
> hard work or by offering goods and services to others is gradually
> losing its value while sitting in our bank accounts, all because
> unelected officials can create more of it at their discretion? How can
> such a system be considered equitable?
>
> Theoretically, the initial step in administering the orange pill

> challenging. The key is to bring people into alignment regarding the
>
> concept of inflation. Anyone who earns an income, pays taxes, or
> possesses any form of financial independence is currently experiencing

> *We Should Despise Inflation:*
>
> My initial question to people usually takes the form of, \"Don\'t you
> detest inflation? Doesn\'t it infuriate you to pay over \$8 for a
> carton of eggs or \$2 per litre for fuel? Doesn\'t this bother you?\"
> Unless they happen to be Larry Fink, I would assume their answer is

> facet of life, I follow up with the following argument, often framed
> in terms of morality. The depth to which you delve into this topic can
> vary, but the central theme should revolve around addressing the
> question of who is most adversely affected during inflationary
> periods. The unequivocal answer is that lower and working-class
> individuals bear the brunt of it. In the words of the late George
> Carlin, \"It\'s a big club, and you ain\'t in it.\" We\'re not merely
> referring to recent years, but rather to every inflationary bubble
> dating back to the 1920s, 1940s, 1970s, 2000s, and beyond. In each

> In simple terms, capital tends to flow towards assets that are the

> The undeniable truth is that inflation primarily benefits individuals

>
> So, we\'ve identified inflation as the problem, but now let\'s delve
> into why it\'s happening. Starting with a straightforward question
> like, \"What do you think has caused inflation over the past two
> years?\" may lead the conversation in different directions. However,
> it\'s likely that you\'ll\
> encounter two main types of answers:
>
> a\) Supply chain disruptions due to factors like wars or the pandemic.
> b) Price gouging by corporations.
>
> The first type of answer relates to a supply shock. While such shocks
> are relatively common in our globalised economy, they don\'t fully
> explain the consistent month-on-month price increases we\'ve witnessed
> over the past 24 months. Supply shocks essentially result from a
> temporary mismatch between supply and demand. When supply chains are
> severely affected, as they were during the war and pandemic,
> especially in critical areas like grain, oil, and natural gas, the
> interconnected global economy feels the strain. Short-term price
> inflation due to unforeseen natural events is inevitable and is akin
> to speed bumps on the road of economic progress.
>
> What\'s important to note is that the free market is best suited to
> address these issues. As Saifedean Amous explains in \"The bitcoin
> Standard,\" an increase in the price of a particular good incentivizes
> producers to increase production, thereby lowering prices back to
> equilibrium. The key point to emphasize here is that the war in
> Ukraine, for example, isn\'t the primary reason why the three-bedroom
> home your parents bought for \$150,000 in 1980 is now comfortably
> valued at over \$1.5 million.
>
> The discussion regarding option B is relatively straightforward.
> During my time as an\
> accountant, I experienced a disruption one morning when the workers\'
> union gathered outside our building, demanding better pay. While not
> an unfair or novel protest topic, I went downstairs to listen to the
> local union representative. He claimed, \"The inflation we\'ve felt
> over the past year is caused by greedy companies and corporate fat
> cats price-gouging regular Australians.\" Additionally, I\'ve come
> across claims in newspaper articles and the general news suggesting
> that the increase in corporate profits has contributed to 30-40% of
> the inflation over the last year.
>
> In my view, responding to this argument requires little more than a
> moment\'s reflection. Were these corporations equally greedy in 2019?
> Why didn\'t we see double-digit inflation and widespread price-gouging
> four years ago? If corporations exist primarily to maximize profits,
> why is this happening now? These questions essentially answer
> themselves and strongly suggest that inflation is not primarily caused
> by big businesses but is rather leveraged by them.
>
> While it\'s true that major corporations may use inflation as an
> excuse to raise prices to the detriment of everyone else, this
> argument misses the point. Essentially, it concedes that the source of
> inflation lies further upstream.
>
> From this point, we\'re on our way. Remember, we\'re not delving too
> deeply just yet. Based on my personal experiences, I\'ve found myself
> stuck by trying to condense everything I\'ve learned over two years
> into such a short amount of time. The result is like a high-powered

> drive spinning its tires in the mud -- too much power, not enough

> of central banks, the emergence of the petrodollar after Bretton
> Woods, the distinctions between bank lending inflation and fiscal
> inflation, as well as the impending debt spiral and the looming credit
> crisis for another occasion. For now, we\'re simply posing a few
> straightforward questions to set this sizable locomotive in motion.
> Eventually, inertia will take care of the rest.
>
> Once we\'ve established that we agree with the normie that inflation
> is immoral, we should take a step further and emphasize that it stems
> from our flawed monetary system. In our current system, money is
> essentially credit, and credit is money. This situation arises from
> how our money is created or \"mined.\" To put it simply, instead of
> new tokens or monetary units being generated by a natural process,
> like the laws of chemistry, our money is brought into existence
> through debt issuance from banks and centrally planned money creation.
>
> Each individual orange piler can delve into this topic in as much
> detail as needed, but in simpler terms, credit expansion increases the
> overall money supply, thereby diluting the value of each individual
> unit. This phenomenon is what we call monetary inflation and explains
> the consistent year-over-year price increases we\'ve grown accustomed
> to seeing.
>
> Returning to the earlier discussion about the morality of the orange
> pill, it\'s crucial to point out that excessive government spending
> and credit creation only worsen the problem they claim to solve.
> There\'s a circular logic at play here, similar to wealth creation.
> The federal government and central banks create inflation through poor
> monetary policies and fiscal deficit spending, which, in turn, fuels
> inflation. Inflation disproportionately affects lower-income
> individuals.
>
> Governments then respond with more spending, causing further
> inflation. Even from the perspective of Keynesian economics, this
> spending won\'t have a 1:1 impact on aggregate demand, thus increasing
> inflation. Therefore, it\'s like a snake eating its own tail: more
> spending drives up inflation, leaving poorer people further behind,
> which necessitates more spending. This is how governments tend to
> expand.
>
> Another point I\'d like the reader to explore with their normie is to
> challenge the necessity of inflation. In my university studies, I was
> taught that the target inflation rate is set at 2-3%, considered a
> \'Goldilocks\' scenario. However, a glaring question arises: why? Why
> does an economy require a consistent 2% inflation rate? Why not 4% or
> 5%? The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) sets the inflation target
> between 2-3% with the goal of \"achieving price stability, full
> employment, and prosperity for the Australian people.\" This answer
> strikes me as absurd, and I prefer to break down the response into
> three subparts.
>
> Firstly, if stability means staying the same, wouldn\'t a better
> target rate be 0%? After all, that\'s the only way prices would
> genuinely remain stable, right? Imagine how much simpler and less
> stressful daily life would be if you could guarantee that prices for
> supermarket goods, insurance, or overseas travel would remain constant
> year after year. Furthermore, you wouldn\'t need to become an
> investment expert just to preserve the money you\'ve already earned,
> because no bank would offer a savings rate higher than inflation. If
> it\'s my money, why can\'t I retain its value?
>
> Secondly, the answer to the aforementioned question is that without
> inflation, our economy would implode. This is not an exaggeration.
> Since our economy is based on credit to fund a large majority of
> transactions, central bankers have no choice but to be married to
> inflation. To illustrate a fundamental debt concept, consider this: I
> borrow \$100 from you today and agree to repay you in a year\'s time.
> Since I repay you in nominal terms, like all debt contracts, with a
> 10% inflation rate, the \$100 I borrowed from you a year ago is
> effectively worth \$90 when I make the payment. As you can see, this
> situation benefits the borrower at the expense of the lender and forms
> a crucial part of why debt is so attractive in our modern economy.
>
> Now, let\'s switch gears and introduce 10% deflation. That same \$100
> we borrowed today would be worth \$110 when we repay it. This poses a
> problem for the borrower, who would incur an additional cost to
> service the debt. If we extrapolate this logic to the \$33 trillion of
> publicly funded debt that the US government owes, we can understand
> why central economies are averse to deflation. It would be
> catastrophic. From this scenario, we can conclude that deflation is
> considered detrimental only in the context of credit-based economies,
> where it could have disastrous consequences. In contrast, in a society
> that not credit based, having items naturally become cheaper over time
> aligns with over 50,000 years of human development. This should be
> viewed as a blessing and aligns with the process of modernizing
> economies.
>
> I\'m not sure if the Chairman of the Federal Reserve has the easiest
> or hardest job in the world.
>
> Instead of debating this, I would liken their role to attempting to
> fit a square peg into a round hole. Runaway debt leads to credit
> bubbles, asset bubbles, and inflation, as we\'ve discussed, and these
> issues have severe and harmful consequences, particularly for the
> lower and middle class. So, you\'d think Jerome Powell has been
> equipped with the best tools imaginable to tackle these challenges,
> right? Wrong. He primarily relies on two tools: a) Creating money out
> of thin air or removing it to directly impact the money supply
> (Quantitative Easing or Tightening), and b) Adjusting borrowing costs
> to indirectly influence the money supply through interest rate
> changes. Both of these tools lack the precision required for the task
> at hand and are assessed only on a monthly basis (quarterly in
> Australia). He is unable to intervene effectively when runaway
> inflation is caused by government deficit spending and his policies
> cannot be voted on in the House or Senate. This is the same for all
> central banks
>
> To further emphasize this point, consider how distant these
> policymakers are from the indicators they use. The heads of central
> banks confidently claim that they closely monitor lagging indicators
> like unemployment, business loan delinquencies, and consumer spending
> to determine if their recent rate adjustments are effective. Let\'s
> put this in simpler terms for our target audience: Did enough people
> lose their jobs? Did enough businesses go bankrupt? Did enough
> families spend so much on their mortgages this month that they can\'t
> afford anything else to justify the Chairman\'s decision? How is this
> not seen as morally questionable? Each lever they pull has the
> potential (and often does) to devastate someone\'s life, particularly

> income each year and are more vulnerable to job losses.

**Identifying the characteristics of the solution**

> The distinction between pessimism and optimism lies in the presence of
> a solution. It can be challenging not to feel somewhat disheartened
> when we chart the trajectories of economic trends and contemplate
> their implications for future generations. However, it\'s crucial to
> connect the issues we\'ve identified with the number one solution:
> bitcoin. To facilitate understanding, I propose breaking down this
> next step into two parts. To make the explanation easier i suggest
> breaking this next step into two parts, and since we know that credit
> is sub optimal money, we need to introduce a hypothetical supermoney.
>
> To possess a currency immune to inflation, it mustn\'t be subject to
> control by governments or centralised entities. Instead, it should be
> governed by a decentralised network, with the currency\'s rules openly
> available to all. The aspect of control is paramount here; no single
> individual can be entrusted with dictating how the money operates.
>
> Our supermoney should thus exhibit characteristics akin to a
> commodity-based currency. While we could delve into an extensive
> history of money, for the purposes of this paper, we\'ll briefly
> traverse this history, highlighting key points. As technology
> advanced, so did trade. In an earlier era, if I had something you
> desired, we would only trade if you possessed something I wanted in
> return. This method works within small groups, but it inherently
> contains friction. This friction is eased by money, which carries an
> attached value. Various forms of money have emerged throughout
> history, but the ones that tend to prevail in any society exhibit
> these characteristics: divisibility, portability, durability,
> fungibility, verifiability, scarcity, and utility.
>
> To underscore these characteristics, we should discuss their
> suitability. Although we\'ve briefly touched on each of them
> throughout our explanations, to effectively convey the idea of an
> \"orange pill,\" we must emphasize that for a currency to succeed, it
> must exhibit suitability across time, space, and scale.
>
> **Salability across time**
>
> Our supermoney needs to be a good store of value. If we think about a
> car or computer, they lose value over time as we use them and they
> become old and obsolete. The depreciation of money is quite different,
> a dollar minted in the year 2000 hasn't changed in its qualities as
> it's still ubiquitous however we need more of them to buy the same
> object. This means that every individual unit of a dollar is
> depreciating and is seen to have a low sailibility across time. For a
> currency to be salable in this regard it must have a low stock to flow
> ratio. The only way to guarantee a low stock to flow ratio is if the
> money physically cannot be issued or controlled by any given group of
> people. Gold rose to prominance over the 15th to 18th centuries as
> commodity money as it beat out all other types of precious metals due
> to its inherent properties and low stock to flow ratio. It didn't
> matter how good the mining technology got the increase in gold around
> the world was consistently between 2-3% for over 150 years. Therefore,
> for our supercurrency to be salable across time it needs to durable,
> fungable and scarce.
>
> **Salability Across Space**
>
> Salability across space refers to a currency\'s capacity to be
> effortlessly transported and accepted across vast distances. For money
> to be salable across space, it must be highly liquid, capable of
> changing hands with minimal friction. This means that it should
> facilitate the instantaneous transfer of wealth across borders to
> fulfill one side of a transaction. In my view, this is precisely what
> led to the decline of gold as a currency. As the world became
> increasingly globalized and trade accelerated, gold couldn\'t keep
> pace with paper money. Consequently, our proposed super currency must
> have the ability to swiftly traverse seas and borders.
>
> It would also be advantageous if this new supercurrency could address
> foreign exchange (FX) issues. Currently, if I want a product from
> overseas, I have to send money abroad to acquire it. Even in our
> current system, this poses challenges. For instance, suppose the item
> I desire is in Germany while I reside in Australia. In such a
> scenario, I must convert my Australian Dollars (AUD) into Euros (EUR),
> likely through an intermediate step involving USD. Notably, I was
> taken aback by the cost when I last engaged in such a transaction.
> While I knew the exchange rate was around \$0.70 when I visited France
> to see my sister, it had dropped to below \$0.55, representing a 13%
> decrease. The reasons behind this can be complex but essentially boil
> down to disparities in interest rate changes between the EU and
> Australia as both economies grapple with inflation. Given that the EU
> offers higher interest rates, more individuals are inclined to invest
> in the EUR compared to a year ago, driving up the Euro\'s price while\
> simultaneously reducing demand for the AUD.
>
> For normies, I would pose the question: wouldn\'t it be more
> convenient if Australia, Europe, and indeed the entire world adopted a
> single currency? How beneficial would this be for developing nations
> if they could simply trade using USD? However, one should consider
> that relying on a single currency like the USD for daily transactions
> would render us increasingly subject to Federal Reserve policy
> decisions that might not align with our best interests. Therefore,
> while our supercurrency should be free from control by any single
> group or organization, it should also be borderless.
>
> **Salability Across Scale**
>
> Our new supermoney must also scale efficiently. It should function as
> a unit of account that can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and
> divided with ease and precision. This is an area where commodity money
> can encounter difficulties. Think back to the days when tobacco and
> shells served as money; how did one determine the value of half a
> shell? Did half a shell equate precisely to half the value of a full
> one? And what about variations in tobacco quality? These are the
> questions our new super currency must address, and it\'s an area where
> fiat money has an advantage. Our supercurrency will be highly
> divisible, eliminating friction caused by incorrect amounts and
> thereby enhancing its utility as a currency.

**Linking these characteristics to bitcoin**

> credit and is not only inherently flawed but also destined to fail
> mathematically. We\'ve also outlined the characteristics of an ideal
> hypothetical money. This is where we draw the connection to bitcoin.
> In this part of the discussion, it\'s beneficial to view bitcoin as a

> money without the associated drawbacks. To bridge this understanding,
> let\'s explore bitcoin\'s engineering, ensuring we provide an
> introduction that doesn\'t delve too deeply into the technical aspects
> but still conveys the authenticity of our argument.
>
> To establish a foundation for understanding bitcoin\'s engineering,
> it\'s advisable to define key terms.
>
> **Open Source** - the code which all bitcoin nodes run on, the code
> for bitcoin can be viewed by anyone in it's enterity. If there is any
> hidden 'bug' or line of code which people don't agree with the network
> will reject it.
>
> **Nodes** - Nodes are individual computers or devices that participate
> in the bitcoin network by storing and verifying transaction data,
> helping to maintain the network\'s security and integrity.
>
> **Blockchain** - Blockchain is the underlying technology of bitcoin,
> consisting of a decentralised and immutable ledger that records all
> bitcoin transactions in chronological order, forming a chain of
> blocks, each containing a batch of transactions.
>
> **Proof of Work** - A piece of data that requires significant
> computation to find. In bitcoin, miners must find a numeric solution
> to the SHA256 algorithm that meets a network-wide target, the
> difficulty target.
>
> **How bitcoin Achieves Salability Across Time**
>
> The key beauty of bitcoin lies in its fixed supply - there will only
> ever be 21,000,000 bitcoins. We previously established that for a
> currency to be both equitable and resilient to price fluctuations, a
> fixed supply is essential, and bitcoin delivers exactly that.
> Additionally, we emphasized the importance of a high stock-to-flow
> ratio, and bitcoin excels here with a ratio of 19 million divided by
> 32 thousand, resulting in a calculation of around 58, and this figure
> can mathematically only go up.
>
> From an engineering perspective, the open-source nature of bitcoin is
> crucial. bitcoin\'s source code is accessible to anyone with a
> computer and an internet connection, and it\'s approved by all network
> nodes. It\'s important to unpack the concept of open source and nodes
> to help your audience grasp this aspect.
>
> **How bitcoin Achieves Salability Across Space**
>
> bitcoin, being an adaptive technology, allows for transactions between
> any two individuals across the globe. With functional layer-two
> technology like the Lightning Network, it can even operate without an
> internet connection. This means there are no foreign exchange (FX)
> variations and minimal frictions when sending money. While we do pay a
> transaction fee to miners for including our transaction on the
> blockchain, it\'s analogous to the fees incurred with Visa or
> Mastercard transactions.
>
> In our quest to Orange Pill, it\'s essential to be open to the idea
> that bitcoin might not function as a primary layer but rather serve as
> the foundational currency upon which secondary fiat layers are
> constructed. Regardless of how you present this to your audience,
> it\'s important to highlight that international settlements become
> significantly more straightforward and cost-effective when using
> bitcoin instead of traditional FX trading. As a side note, it\'s worth
> mentioning that everything is currently priced in USD, so we would
> exchange USD for BTC in this context.
>
> **How bitcoin acheives salability across scale**
>
> bitcoin\'s ability to achieve salability across space is a testament
> to its revolutionary design and the power of decentralised networks.
> Unlike traditional currencies that rely on intermediaries like banks
> and payment processors for cross-border transactions, bitcoin operates
> on a global scale without the need for such middlemen. This inherent
> decentralisation allows individuals\
> worldwide to engage in peer-to-peer transactions, bridging
> geographical gaps effortlessly. What sets bitcoin apart is its
> lightning-fast transaction speeds and minimal transaction fees, making
> it the go-to option for cross-border payments. With bitcoin,
> geographical borders become virtually irrelevant as it enables secure
> and instantaneous value transfer across the world.
>
> Furthermore, bitcoin\'s borderless nature makes it a driving force
> behind the future of\
> international commerce and financial inclusion. It serves as a bridge
> between traditional fiat currencies, simplifying international
> settlements and reducing the complexities associated with foreign
> exchange trading. As a global standard, bitcoin is increasingly used
> to denominate values and facilitate cross-border trade. This
> transformation in how we perceive and conduct cross-border
> transactions not only enhances the efficiency of global finance but
> also empowers individuals in regions with limited access to

> *"Bitcoin Has No Intrinsic Value"*
>
> The argument that bitcoin lacks intrinsic value is commonly raised by
> skeptics, including those who may not be well-versed in the subject
> and those who prefer alternative assets like gold. To counter this
> point, it\'s essential to recognise that value is fundamentally
> subjective. While some argue for an objective value based on
> quantifiable factors, such as the labor required for production, the
> Austrian perspective highlights the subjectivity of value, tied
> closely to\
> individuals\' preferences and needs. In the case of bitcoin, its value
> is rooted in what it\
> represents: a viable alternative to the existing financial system. It
> stands as a form of money impervious to inflation and beyond the
> control of central authorities. The distinction between bitcoin as a
> store of value and a medium of exchange should not be perceived as a
> flaw, as individuals will always seek avenues for consumption and
> investment.
>
> *"Bitcoin Is Too Volatile to Be Money"*
>
> The assertion that bitcoin could never function as a global currency
> due to its perceived volatility rests on a logical fallacy. Volatility
> is a measure of the rate of change in the price of any asset or
> currency. When discussing bitcoin\'s volatility, it\'s crucial to
> consider the broader trend. Over the years, bitcoin\'s volatility has
> consistently decreased as adoption has expanded. This means that it
> now requires a more substantial influx of capital to trigger
> significant price fluctuations, resulting in greater price stability.
> While some criticise bitcoin\'s price swings, it\'s worth noting that
> owning an asset with occasional fluctuations may be preferable to
> holding one with a consistently diminishing value.
>
> *"Bitcoin Is a Ponzi Scheme"*
>
> The accusation that bitcoin is akin to a Ponzi scheme is often tossed
> around when people conflate bitcoin with the broader cryptocurrency
> market. Critics frequently point to issues on cryptocurrency exchanges
> like FTX or Binance as evidence of the entire crypto space being
> fraudulent. It\'s essential to distinguish bitcoin from other
> cryptocurrencies in this context. bitcoin is a completely
> decentralised open-source protocol with a proven track record of
> security through verified proof of work. Unlike many other
> cryptocurrencies, it fully embodies these three critical attributes.
> As such, bitcoin stands as a distinct entity, closer to the ideals of\
> decentralisation and security, in contrast to other cryptocurrencies
> that may not share these qualities. For many proponents of bitcoin,
> other cryptocurrencies often hold little relevance.
>
> *"Bitcoin will never be a better asset than housing"*
>
> In the context of people saving money (in fiat) for a house deposit
> compared to those saving to acquire bitcoins, the argument often
> revolves around the underlying beliefs. When individuals advocate for
> real estate over bitcoin, it seems that certain core convictions guide
> their preferences. They may not consciously consider that real estate,
> since the 1970s, inherently carries a monetary premium. Consequently,
> they view real estate not solely as an investment opportunity but as a
> primary place of residence, with potential for future profit upon
> sale. Many
>
> individuals invest their entire equity in their homes (sometimes with
> 150% debt) due to the common belief that \'property values always
> appreciate,\' without delving into the reasons behind this trend.
> It\'s crucial to remember that the poor monetary management by central
> banks compels people to seek stores of value for their money. In light
> of this, why not allocate this monetary premium into the currency
> itself?
>
> In conclusion, I\'d like to point out that the journey of adopting the
> orange pill may not always be easy, and I\'m asserting that this
> isn\'t necessarily the definitive argument on how to do it. To be
> candid, this is the first paper I\'ve ever written outside of school
> and university settings. I embarked on this endeavor not only to prove
> to myself that I can write but also to develop and explore ideas to
> their logical conclusions, to test if they can stand on their own
> merits.
>
> We can all make educated guesses about where bitcoin\'s price is
> headed, but in reality, who truly knows? Tomorrow, it may surge to
> \$60k or plummet to zero. Nonetheless, I remain appreciative of the
> valuable lessons I\'ve learned on this journey. These lessons
> encompass concepts like reducing time preference, maintaining
> consistent effort, embracing a diet of unprocessed foods, recognizing
> the importance of family and friends, and understanding the perils of
> excessive alcohol consumption. These are lessons that I\'ve gathered
> during my journey, and I intend to carry them forward and share them
> with others indefinitely.
>
> I hope that this paper can lead to opportunities, but ultimately,
> bitcoin has enabled me to find my center and become a better person,
> just as I hope it does for you.
